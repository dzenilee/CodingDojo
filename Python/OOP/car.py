Create a class called  Car. In the__init__(), allow the user to specify the following attributes: price, speed, fuel, mileage. If the price is greater than 10,000, set the tax to be 15%. Otherwise, set the tax to be 12%.

Create six different instances of the class Car. In the class have a method called display_all() that returns all the information about the car as a string. In your __init__(), call this display_all() method to display information about the car once the attributes have been defined.
