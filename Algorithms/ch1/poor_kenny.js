//Kenny tries to stay safe, but somehow everyday something happens. If there is a 10% chance of volcano, 15% chance of tsunami, 20% chance of earthquake, 25% chance of blizzard, and 30% chance of meteor strike, write function whatHappensToday() to print the outcome.

//Need help. Not done

function whatHappensToday(){
  var volcano = .1;
  var tsunami = .2;
  var earthquake = .25;
  var blizzard = .25;
  var meteor_strike = .3;

  volcano *
