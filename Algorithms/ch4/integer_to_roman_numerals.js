//Given a positive integer that is less than 4000, return a string containing that value in Roman numeral representation. In this representation, I is 1, V is 5, X is 10, L=50, C=100, D=500, and M=1000. Remember that 4 is IV, 349 is CCCIL and 444 is CDXLIV.

C = 100
D = 500

X = 10
L = 50

I = 1
V = 5


C = 100
C = 100
C = 100

I = 1
L = 50
