/*
For this challenge, we will look not only at the entire string provided, but also at the substrings within it. Return the longest palindromic substring. Given "what up, daddy-o?", return "dad". Given "uh... not much", return "u".

Include spaces as well (i.e., be strict, as in previous challenge): given "Yikes! my favorite racecar erupted!", return "e racecar e". Strings longer or shorter than complete words are OK.
